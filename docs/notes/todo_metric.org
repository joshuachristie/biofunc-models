* analysis
** compare kimura vs simulation fixation probability 
*** TODO fix import of diffusion approx (make module instead of package)
*** add python subprocess module that contains function needed to interface with C++ [0/3]
    - [ ] check whether correct output files exist: get a list of those that don't
    - [ ] run C++ model in parallel to generate missing simulation fix probs
    - [ ] change C++ main so that it prints to an output file (named by parameter values) rather than to std::cout
*** loop through files with fixation probs [0/2]
    - [ ] add wait in script until all simulation fix prob output files have been produced
    - [ ] open files, get fixation probs, and plot
* models
** finish individual-based model [0/5]
   - [ ] use simple IBM model (simple_model.py) as base
   - [ ] add environmental state as Individual class variable
   - [ ] update fitnesses
   - [ ] add number of max gens to termination condition
   - [ ] add number of replicates to model
