""" 
Starting with a basic model with the following properties:
- haploid with two alleles (p and q)
- two environmental types (E_p and E_q)
- "infinite" number of environments with frequency P(E_p) and P(E_q)
- variable fitness of each allele in each environment (p matched to E_p; q matched to E_q)
- model can switch between deterministic and stochastic
